{"name":"DARTing-Around","tagline":"Developer Diary","body":"Welcome to the DARTing-Around Developer Diary!\r\n\r\nWant to beta test this? Of course you do but spaces are very limited! Contact me and I'll arrange it if I can. It'll make it easier if you have an account with Hockey App.\r\n\r\nIf you want to watch the progress of this app in the style of tickets - I'm using GitHub Issues to track the detail of the work so have a look over there.\r\n\r\n### Day 1 / Day\r\n\r\nThis thing started on 14 October 2013 when I asked on Twitter if there were any good apps for getting train times for the Dublin DART trains. [@ncremins](https://twitter.com/ncremins), [@adamkmccarthy](https://twitter.com/adamkmccarthy), [@oisin](https://twitter.com/oisin) and I then had a discussion about the fact that there wasn't (that we were aware of) but that an API did exist. Oisin has actually done some work on this with a [ruby wrapper for the API](https://github.com/oisin/ierail)\r\n\r\nThis is the documentation for the API itself: [Irish Rail Realtime API](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/)\r\n\r\nSo during the day I thought I'd have a go at this, and that I would document the process for everyone to see. So, hi :)\r\n\r\n### Day 1 / Night\r\n\r\nI got started at night on this app and had a basic app talking to the Irish Rail server via their API within an hour or so. The only tricky part was that the server thinks it's 1998 so is using XML. I haven't parsed XML for years so had to go back and find out how to do that.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other things I want to achieve with this project that I am also going to use it for so I started on those too:\r\n\r\n* Learn Cocoapods (I know Ruby pretty well, so this is fairly easy)\r\n* Use autolayout, properly this time!\r\n* Run this through the new Continuous Integration setup on Xcode 5 and Mac OS X Server\r\n* Set up Mixpanel properly for stats (that will come later)\r\n\r\nI CANNOT work on app without a name and a logo, so I had to spend an hour coming up with these too, I went to the hotel bar and did this over dinner. They may well change but they'll do for now :) By the end of the night \"DARTing Around\" was running and pulling in station data. It even displayed the station name on the detail screen if you tapped on a table cell. Good start but I had a new series of The Walking Dead to get started on so the rest will have to wait until tomorrow.\r\n\r\n### Day 2 / Night (Tuesday)\r\n\r\nI'm working in the hotel bar tonight as it's the last night of World Cup qualifiers. I'd say this should be very productive!\r\n\r\nWell, that wasn't too productive. Spent two hours on the parser, mostly trying to get dates to parse - they won't, they just refuse. So there are no dates in the app now. Tough shit if you wanted dates, you can't have them.\r\n\r\nHowever, journeys now parse correctly and if I can get a table cell formatted tomorrow to show when the trains are due at your station that will constitute a minimum viable product that people can test with. yay!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
