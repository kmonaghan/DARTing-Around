          <p>Welcome to the DARTing-Around Developer Diary!</p>

<p>Want to beta test this? Of course you do but spaces are very limited! Contact me and I'll arrange it if I can. It'll make it easier if you have an account with Hockey App.</p>

<p>If you want to watch the progress of this app in the style of tickets - I'm using GitHub Issues to track the detail of the work so have a look over there.</p>

<a name="day-1--day" class="anchor" href="#day-1--day"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day 1 / Day</h3>

<p>This thing started on 14 October 2013 when I asked on Twitter if there were any good apps for getting train times for the Dublin DART trains. <a href="https://twitter.com/ncremins">@ncremins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adamkmccarthy">@adamkmccarthy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/oisin">@oisin</a> and I then had a discussion about the fact that there wasn't (that we were aware of) but that an API did exist. Oisin has actually done some work on this with a <a href="https://github.com/oisin/ierail">ruby wrapper for the API</a></p>

<p>This is the documentation for the API itself: <a href="http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/">Irish Rail Realtime API</a></p>

<p>So during the day I thought I'd have a go at this, and that I would document the process for everyone to see. So, hi :)</p>

<h3>
<a name="day-1--night" class="anchor" href="#day-1--night"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day 1 / Night</h3>

<p>I got started at night on this app and had a basic app talking to the Irish Rail server via their API within an hour or so. The only tricky part was that the server thinks it's 1998 so is using XML. I haven't parsed XML for years so had to go back and find out how to do that.</p>

<p>There are a few other things I want to achieve with this project that I am also going to use it for so I started on those too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn Cocoapods (I know Ruby pretty well, so this is fairly easy)</li>
<li>Use autolayout, properly this time!</li>
<li>Run this through the new Continuous Integration setup on Xcode 5 and Mac OS X Server</li>
<li>Set up Mixpanel properly for stats (that will come later)</li>
</ul><p>I CANNOT work on app without a name and a logo, so I had to spend an hour coming up with these too, I went to the hotel bar and did this over dinner. They may well change but they'll do for now :) By the end of the night "DARTing Around" was running and pulling in station data. It even displayed the station name on the detail screen if you tapped on a table cell. Good start but I had a new series of The Walking Dead to get started on so the rest will have to wait until tomorrow.</p>

<h3>
<a name="day-2--tuesday-night" class="anchor" href="#day-2--tuesday-night"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day 2 / Tuesday Night</h3>

<p>I'm working in the hotel bar tonight as it's the last night of World Cup qualifiers. I'd say this should be very productive!</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't too productive. Spent two hours on the parser, mostly trying to get dates to parse - they won't, they just refuse. So there are no dates in the app now. Tough shit if you wanted dates, you can't have them.</p>

<p>However, journeys now parse correctly and if I can get a table cell formatted tomorrow to show when the trains are due at your station that will constitute a minimum viable product that people can test with. yay!</p>

<h3>
<a name="day-3--thursday-night" class="anchor" href="#day-3--thursday-night"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day 3 / Thursday Night</h3>

<p>Tonight I was mostly dealing with admin things - getting the build to work as cocoapods was interfering with archive builds took a bit of time unfortunately. Still not convinced about cocoapods! Provisioning and setting up Hockey App always takes longer than it should :) And I had to create individual icons for alpa, beta, and live builds - very important that step. Finally I updated the previous wiki pages in to this page and moved the To Dos in to GitHub issues</p>

<p>In terms of code I got through this stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>Train and Journey models were created</li>
<li>The station model was updated to conform to NSCoding</li>
<li>Stations array is now cached "on disk" and only updated once per day for speedy startup</li>
<li>Implemented pull to refresh on Stations list</li>
<li>I made the Journey (detail) screen look better with a custom table cell on the detail table</li>
<li>Added pull to refresh to the detail screen</li>
<li>Put in a control to allow the user to chose Northbound, Southbound or All trains</li>
</ul><p>And finally at 11:15 the first build went out to testers, yay \o/</p>

<p>I'm heading home to spend time with my family for the weekend so nothing else will be done on this until Monday. I'm happy with that weeks work though - probably 8-10 hours in total and the app is useable. Next up is adding cool features.</p>
